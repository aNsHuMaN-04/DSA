// arr[0….low-1] contains 0. [Extreme left part]
// arr[low….mid-1] contains 1.
// arr[high+1….n-1] contains 2. [Extreme right part], n = size of the array
// The middle part i.e. arr[mid….high] is the unsorted segment.

// If arr[mid] == 0, we will swap arr[low] and arr[mid] and will increment both low and mid. Now the subarray from index 0 to (low-1) only contains 0.
// If arr[mid] == 1, we will just increment the mid pointer and then the index (mid-1) will point to 1 as it should according to the rules.
// If arr[mid] == 2, we will swap arr[mid] and arr[high] and will decrement high. Now the subarray from index high+1 to (n-1) only contains 2.
// In this step, we will do nothing to the mid-pointer as even after swapping,
// the subarray from mid to high(after decrementing high) might be unsorted.
// So, we will check the value of mid again in the next iteration.
